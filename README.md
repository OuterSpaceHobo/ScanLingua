# ScanLingua
ScanLingua provides recognition, translation and kanji annotation of selected screen areas.

It is great for checking on subtitles, manga text bubbles or any japanese text.

This project is heavily inspired with Yomichan and use awesome japanese dictionary Jotoba for kanji annotation.

To-Do list: work on design; fix errors and expand existing functionality; add annotation for chinese and korean languages; add Anki integration.
