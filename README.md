# ScanLingua
ScanLingua provides recognition, translation and kanji annotation of selected screen areas.

It is great for checking on subtitles, manga text bubbles or any japanese text.

This project is heavily inspired with Yomichan and use awesome japanese dictionary Jotoba for kanji annotation.

DEFAULT_API_KEY is NOT provided in this repo (check service_worker/public/index.js/line 76; service_worker/src/messages.ts/ line 17).

To-Do list: work on design; fix errors and expand existing functionality; add annotation for chinese and korean languages; add Anki integration.
